YABSS is a simple mod that makes a town NPC sell boss summoning items when you defeat the respective vanilla boss. The price for these items depends on the difficulty of the boss and placement for progression.

For the best cross-mod compatability, the NPC that sells summoning items is configurable to your preference. In the mod config, you can choose any of the pre-Hardmode town NPCs with a shop. It defaults to the Clothier.

After defeating the Wall of Flesh, he will sell Innocent, Helpless Bunnies that can summon the Wall of Flesh without murdering the Guide. After defeating Plantera, he will sell a Peppery Fruit that summons her without need of a bulb. Finally, downing the Moon Lord will cause him to sell Cracked Relics that summon him instantly instead of after a delay.

If you have a mod like Calamity that already has this function built in, you won't need this mod.
