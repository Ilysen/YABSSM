YABSS (pronounced "yabs") adds vanilla boss summoning items to a town NPC when you defeat their respective boss. For cross-mod compatibility, the NPC that sells the items can be configured to any pre-hardmode NPC in the base game, but defaults to the Dryad. Also adds purchasable instant summoning items for the following bosses: Wall of Flesh, Plantera, Empress of Light, Moon Lord.

If you have a mod like Calamity that already has this function built in, you probably won't need this one!
