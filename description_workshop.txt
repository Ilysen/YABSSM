YABSS (pronounced "yabs") adds vanilla boss summoning items to a town NPC when you defeat their respective boss. For cross-mod compatibility, the NPC that sells the items can be configured to any pre-hardmode NPC in the base game, but defaults to the Dryad. Also adds purchasable instant summoning items for the following bosses: Wall of Flesh, Plantera, Empress of Light, Moon Lord.

If you have a mod like Calamity that already has this function built in, you probably won't need this one!

By default, summon items are available only after killing the respective boss, but the config has an alternate progression option that unlocks them at different times. This follows the following conditions:
* Slime Crowns and Suspicious Looking Eyes are available immediately
* Downing the Eye of Cthulhu unlocks Worm Food or Bloody Spines
* Downing the evil boss unlocks Clothier Voodoo Dolls
* Downing Skeletron unlocks Abeeminations and Deer Things
* Downing the Queen Bee unlocks Helpless Bunnies (Wall of Flesh)
* Gelatin Crystals and mech boss summons appear immediately at the start of hardmode
* Downing the mech bosses unlocks Peppery Fruits (Plantera)
* Downing Plantera unlocks Eepy Lacewings (Empress of Light), Lihzahrd Power Cells, Truffle Worms, Pumpkin Moon Medallions, and Naughty Presents
* Downing the Lunatic Cultist unlocks Cracked Relics
