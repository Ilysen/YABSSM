# Yet Another Boss Summon Shop Mod

YABSS is a simple mod that makes the Clothier sell boss summoning items when you defeat the respective vanilla boss. The price for these items depends on the difficulty of the boss and placement for progression.

After defeating the Wall of Flesh, he will sell Innocent, Helpless Bunnies that can summon the Wall of Flesh without murdering the Guide. After defeating Plantera, he will sell a Peppery Fruit that summons her without need of a bulb. Finally, downing the Moon Lord will cause him to sell Cracked Relics that summon him instantly instead of after a delay.

If you have a mod like Calamity that already has this function built in, you won't need this mod.
